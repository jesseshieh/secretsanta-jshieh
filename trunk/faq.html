        <div class="content">
          Secret Santa is a way to exchange gifts within a group of people that
          is both fun and saves you money.  Normally, if you have a lot of friends,
          you'd have to buy everyone a present and they'd probably be small.  If you
          organize a secret santa gift exchange, though, each person puts their
          name into a hat and then each person secretly draws a name from the hat.
          The person they get is the person they have to buy a present for.  So
          they only have to buy one present and everyone in the group gets one.

        </div>

          <a href="http://www.secret-santa-organizer.com">www.secret-santa-organizer.com</a>
          makes the experience easier by bringing the exchange online.  This means
          that you don't have to get everyone in the same room just to draw names.  And
          you don't have to find a hat (or paper and pencil).  It also
          enables some interesting features like blacklisting people.
          <br/><br/>
          Instead of drawing names from a hat, secret santa assignments get automatically
          generated on the sign-up deadline for those people who responded yes to your
          invitation.  Nobody will know who everyone else has, except for you (and only
          if you want to know).

          <div class="title">How do I use this site?</div>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          Using this site is as easy as filling out a form.
          <br/><br/>
          In <b>step 1</b>, you have to decide how much people should spend on their gift.  Enter
          this in the &quot;spend limit&quot;box.  Then you have to decide where and when to actually
          exchange the gifts.  If you aren't sure just leave it as TBD (to be determined).
          If you plan on mailing the gifts, just write in &quot;mail it!&quot;  Last thing to
          do is enter in the date and time to exchange the gifts.
          <br/><br/>
          In <b>step 2</b>, you have to decide who you want to invite.  Don't worry about inviting
          someone who might not want to participate.  They'll get an email asking them
          to respond yes or no.  If they don't respond, then they won't be included.
          You can leave this blank at first if you want since you can invite more people later.
          <br/><br/>
          You also have to choose a sign-up deadline.  At 11:59pm of the sign-up deadline,
          those people who responded yes to the invitation will get put into a virtual hat and
          names will be drawn.  Each person gets a personalized email telling them who they
          need o buy a gift for.  Nobody else will know who they got except for you (and only if
          you want to know).
          <br/><br/>
          In <b>step 3</b>, we just ask you for your email address so we can send you a link to
          manage the event in case you want to change stuff later like invite more people or
          change dates.
          <br/><br/>
          And you're all done!  Click &quot;Send Invitations&quot; and you'll see a pop-up where
          you can include an optional custom message.  Click &quot;Send&quot; and the invitations
          get sent to everyone on your list.  Afterwards, you're taken directly to the manage
          page where you can change things and add more people.
