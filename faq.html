        <div class="content">
          Secret Santa is a way to exchange gifts within a group of people that
          is both fun and saves you money.  Normally, if you have a lot of friends,
          you'd have to buy everyone a present and each present would probably be small.  When you
          organize a secret santa gift exchange, each person in your group puts their
          name into a hat and then each person secretly draws a name from the hat.
          The person they get is the person they have to buy a present for.  So
          they only have to buy one present and everyone in the group gets one.

          <div class="title">Why is using this site easier than using a hat?</div>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <a href="http://www.secret-santa-organizer.com">www.secret-santa-organizer.com</a>
          makes the organizing easier by bringing the exchange online.  This means
          that you don't have to get everyone in the same room just to draw names.  And
          you don't have to find a hat (or paper and pencil).  It also
          enables some interesting features like blacklists, anonymous messages, and more.
          <br/><br/>
          Instead of drawing names from a hat, secret santa assignments get automatically
          generated on the sign-up deadline for those people who responded yes to your
          invitation.  Nobody will know who everyone else has, except for the organizer (and only
          if he/she wants to know).

          <div class="title">How do I use this site to create a secret santa?</div>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          Using this site is as easy as filling out a form.
          <br/><br/>
          In <b>step 1</b>, you have to decide how much people should spend on their gift.  Enter
          this in the &quot;spend limit&quot; box.  Then you have to decide where and when to actually
          exchange the gifts.  If you aren't sure just leave it as TBD (to be determined).
          If you plan on mailing the gifts, just write in &quot;mail it!&quot;. Last thing to
          do is enter in the date and time to exchange the gifts.
          <br/><br/>
          In <b>step 2</b>, you have to decide who you want to invite.  Don't worry about inviting
          someone who might not want to participate.  They'll get an email asking them
          to respond yes or no.  If they don't respond, then they won't be included.
          You can leave this blank at first if you want since you can invite more people later.
          <br/><br/>
          You also have to choose a sign-up deadline.  At 11:59pm of the sign-up deadline,
          those people who responded yes to the invitation will get put into a virtual hat and
          names will be drawn.  Each person gets a personalized email telling them who they
          need o buy a gift for.  Nobody else will know who they got except for you (and only if
          you want to know).
          <br/><br/>
          In <b>step 3</b>, we just ask you for your email address so we can send you a link to
          manage the event in case you want to change stuff later like invite more people or
          change dates.
          <br/><br/>
          And you're all done!  Click &quot;Send Invitations&quot; and you'll see a pop-up where
          you can include an optional custom message.  Click &quot;Send&quot; and the invitations
          get sent to everyone on your list.  Afterwards, you're taken directly to the manage
          page where you can change things and add more people.

    <div class="box">
      <div class="section">
        <div class="label">
          <div class="title">I got an invitation email, how do I respond or sign up?</div>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          There should be a link in the email you received to respond.  Click on that link and
          you'll be taken to a webpage.  All you have to do on this page is click the
          &quot;Sign up&quot; button and you're set to participate in the exchange, but it would
          be helpful for your secret santa if you entered in your name and a gift hint as well.
          Once you've signed up, you just wait for an email after the sign-up deadline which
          will tell you who you need to buy a gift for.
          <br/><br/>
          The gift hint can be anything you want.  You can list specific items or you can just say
          that you like the color pink.  It's up to you what to put in there.
          <br/><br/>
          There is also the option to blacklist someone.  By adding someone into your blacklist,
          we'll try our best not to assign them to you.  They might still end up buying a present
          for you, but you won't have to buy a present for them.  In the rare case that there
          are too many blacklist requests and there is no possible way to arrange the exchange
          honoring everyone's blacklist, we'll randomly remove people from someone's blacklist
          until the exchange is possible.  We have sophisticated algorithms in place to make
          sure this is done fairly.
          <br/><br/>
          Anytime you make a change to your gift hint or blacklist, you have to click &quot;Save&quot;
          or &quot;Sign up&quot; for those changes to take effect.

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          Now you just need to go out and buy that person a gift and bring it to the exchange.  The
          person you need to buy a gift for should be listed in the email you received.  If you need
          a reminder of when the exchange is or how much to spend, you can click on the link provided
          in the email.

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          It probably means that not enough people have signed up.  In order for the secret santa exchange to
          work properly, at least two people need to have signed up.  Try inviting more people, sending out
          reminder emails, or signing people up manually.
